# Regression Tree Learning
Tree creation, pruning, bagging and random forest predictor for "Knowledge engineering" exam. The topics covered are, tree creation using the CART algorithm,
tree pruning using cost complexity pruning and weakest link cutting and ensemble methods like bagging and random forest. The algorithms have been written from scratch, 
the scikit learn library has been used only for dataset partitioning tasks (k fold cross validation and dataset resampling).
