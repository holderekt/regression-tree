# Regression tree, pruning and random forest
Tree creation, pruning, bagging and random forest predictor. The topics covered are, 
- Tree creation using the CART algorithm
- Tree pruning using cost complexity pruning
- Weakest link cutting and 
- Ensemble methods like bagging and random forest. 

The algorithms have been written from scratch, the scikit learn library has been used only for dataset partitioning tasks (k fold cross validation and dataset resampling).
